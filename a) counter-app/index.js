// 1. ACCESSING DOM ELEMENT

// in javascript, document is used to reffer the current page where this script will be called

// below, we're getting the html element by id and set 5 as the new text
document.getElementById("count").innerText = 5

// everything after this double slash is called a line comment

// 2. USING VARIABLES
// We use let & const mostly, this replaces var
let count = 12; 

// we also use console.log(something) to print on cconsole the value or data we want to observe
console.log(count)
// to see this happening, go to any browser, prefferably chrome, then right click=>inspect=>console
